This project analyzes loan default risk using three datasets: Loans.csv, Borrowers.csv, and Repayments.csv. It includes SQL queries, data preparation, and EDA to assess default rates and correlations between borrower characteristics and defaults. The findings are presented with visualizations and strategic recommendations on P2P lending dynamics.
